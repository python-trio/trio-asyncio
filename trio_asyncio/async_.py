        This default handler simply re-raises an exception if there is one.

        Rationale:

        In traditional asyncio, there frequently is no context which the
        exception is supposed to affect.

        Trio-asyncio, however, collects the loop and all its tasks in a
        nursery. Thus the context which must be aborted, and thus in which
        the error needs to be raised, is known / can easily be controlled
        by the programmer.

        For maximum compatibility, this default handler is only used in
        asynchronous loops.
